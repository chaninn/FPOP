Oligomerization in Fluorescent Proteins (FP) hinders the usage as a marker 
for protein tagging. The problems include but not limited to abnormal localization,
interfering with signaling cascades and disturing the normal function of tagged proteins.
Predicting the oligomeric States of Fourescent protein may help live biomedical imaginngs 
and fasten the efforts in creating monomeric FP. Thus, the webserver is dedicated to predict
the oligomeric states of FP using only sequence informations to determine whether uploaded
sequences are Oligomeric or Monomeric FP. Fluorescent Protein Oligomerization Predictor (FPOP)
does not require any knownlege in programming with user friendly web interface in which only mouse clicks
or copy-and-paste is necessary to predict the oligomerization of fluorescent protein based on the 
information from sequence. 

# 1. Upload Protein Sequence

Currently, there are two ways you can upload protein sequences to the server. Protein sequences can be uploaded by
either copying and pasting to the textbox or choosing a FASTA file. Please open the webbrowser (i.e., firefox, chrome)
to nevigate to the [FPOP](http://codes.bio/fpop/) website. You will see the homepage of the FPOP.
